# Releasing NodeBox

Installers are built in GitHub Actions by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml),
which mirrors the approach used by the [figment](https://github.com/figmentapp/figment) project:

| Trigger | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Push to `master` | macOS `.dmg` + Windows `.msi` uploaded as **workflow artifacts** (nightly) |
| Tag `v*` (e.g. `v3.0.53`) | Same installers attached to a **GitHub Release** |
| Manual `workflow_dispatch` | Build on demand |

Both runners use the **same Temurin JDK** (`JAVA_VERSION` in the workflow). `jpackage`
bundles a runtime matching the runner architecture — so `macos-latest` yields a **native
arm64** app (no Rosetta) and `windows-latest` yields an x64 `.msi`.

## Cutting a release

1. Bump `nodebox.version` in `src/main/resources/version.properties`.
2. Commit, then tag and push:
   ```sh
   git tag v3.0.53
   git push origin v3.0.53
   ```
3. The workflow signs + notarizes the macOS build and creates the GitHub Release.

## Required repository secrets (macOS signing & notarization)

Set these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Windows is currently
shipped unsigned, so no Windows secrets are needed. If the macOS secrets are absent the
build still succeeds but produces an **unsigned** `NodeBox-unsigned.zip` instead of a `.dmg`.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` | Base64 of your *Developer ID Application* certificate exported as `.p12` |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD` | The password set when exporting the `.p12` |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Any throwaway string; used to create a temporary keychain on the runner |
| `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY` | Identity name, e.g. `Developer ID Application: Frederik De Bleser (5X78EYG9RH)` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email used for notarization |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password generated at <https://appleid.apple.com> |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Developer Team ID, e.g. `5X78EYG9RH` |

### Exporting the certificate

In **Keychain Access**, find *Developer ID Application: …*, right-click → **Export** as
`.p12` (set a password — that's `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD`). Then base64-encode it for the
`MACOS_CERTIFICATE` secret:

```sh
base64 -i Certificates.p12 | pbcopy
```

## Building locally

The same Ant targets run locally (signing uses your login keychain and the env vars above):

```sh
ant dist-mac sign-mac   # macOS: app image -> sign -> dmg -> notarize -> staple
ant dist-win            # Windows: .msi (requires WiX Toolset v3 on PATH)
```

Override the JDK used for packaging with `-Djpackage=/path/to/jdk/bin/jpackage`; by default
it uses the JDK running Ant (`${java.home}/bin/jpackage`).

## Known follow-up: bundled ffmpeg is Intel-only

`platform/mac/bin/ffmpeg` is an `x86_64` binary. The app itself is now native arm64, but
video export shells out to this ffmpeg, which still needs Rosetta. Replace it with an
arm64 (or universal) ffmpeg build to make NodeBox fully Rosetta-free ahead of macOS 28.
